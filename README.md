# 1. WeReviewResidences

WeReviewResidences is a web application for international students to give reviews and ratings for residences where they stay.
The residences in this website are properties of the Esguerra family. My parents have hosted students for almost 20 years, 
ever since i was a child. We have received students from schools such as Concordia, ILSC, Lasalle, Vanier, McGill and many more
language schools in Montreal. We have hosted students from than 50 countries around the world. Some of these students have
stayed with us as little as one week, others have stayed for more than 2 years, but the average student has usually stayed
with us for about 6 months or 1 semester.

I made this website because I thought it would be useful for students to be more trustful or our residence as they look for a place to stay In Montreal.
